# ColourBuddy
A random color generator. What's more to say?

Colour Buddy allows the generation of random colors. In this release, it has a handful of colours. Colours can be added by calling the addColour method and a random colour can be generated by calling the newColour method. A string with the hex colour code is called.

In a future release, the abilty to get colour in other formats other than HEX will be added as well as other helpful functions.

This helper library is part of the larger Courier project but is now available standalone. Feel free to use, modify and pass on!
